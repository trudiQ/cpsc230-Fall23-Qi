1. 
a) Write a function, euclidean(), that takes in 4 parameters, x1, y1, x2, and y2,
    and calculate the euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
    Return the euclidean distance as a number.
    Make the default arguments 1 for all four parameters.
b) Calcuate and print the euclidean distance between two points (1, 1) and (2, 2) by calling the function.
    (you should see 1.4142.. which is the square root of 2)
NOTE: FULL CREDIT: Use exponent operator ** and other necessary arithmetic operators for this question.

Hint:
    Euclidean distance = square root of (x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1)
    Refer to the power function in Q3 in the in-class exercise for lecture 13 on
    how to calculate square root.

2. There is a triangle of three vertices (points) (0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 0). 
    a) Create a list of tuples, named coordinates, to store those three vertices. 
    b) Use a FOR-LOOP to iteratue the list and print all the vertex coordinates 
        in the format of "X: 2, Y: 2".
    c) Calculate the euclidean distances (using Q1's function) between the first two vertices (tuples) in
    coordinates, Print out the result in this format: 
        "The euclidean distance between [first vertex] and [second vertex] is [result]"
    NOTE: Use indexing to access the first two tupes in coordinates; DO NOT use those numbers directly.
Hint: 
    Refer to Page 9 in Lecture 14 on how to access an item in a tuple in a list.
