1. Guess the number. Randomly generate a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive). Ask the user guess a number
between 1 to 10 (inclusive). If they guess too high, print "It's too high, try again!"; if they guess
too low, print "It's too low, try again!". Continue asking them until they guess it right and print "You are right!"
PART 1: Define a function that has a number as its input. Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive), 
and then compare it with the input number and print out the result (i.e., too high or too low).
Repeatedly ask the user until the user guesses it right.
PART 2: Randomly generate an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and invoke the function defined above with
this number to compare it with the user input number. 

Hint: 
- randint(a, b) is a function from a built-in library named random (see above import random)
that can be used to generate a random integer, N, between two integers, a and b, where a <= N <= b.
See Refer to Q0 in in-class 12 for more details about how to use random.randint(a, b).
- Use a while loop with True condition inside the function definition for repeatedly asking for user input.

2. Write some code that asks the user to input a number greater than 0
and prints out "It's a perfect square" if it's a perfect square and
"It's not a perfect square" otherwise. Before checking if the number 
is a perfect square, check the number is actually greater than 0, and 
only perform your perfect squre check if it is.
PART 1: Define a function to check the input integer and return True if 
it is a perfect square and False otherwise.
PART 2: Ask the user to type any integer, use the function you
defined above to check if it's a perfect square or not, and print out the result.

Hint: 
- A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product
of an integer with itself. For example, 25 is a perfect square because it 
is the produce of integer 5 by itself. In other words, a perfect-square number 
equals to the product of the square root by itself (25 == 5 * 5).
- Calculate the square root of the given number using exponent operator (**).
