# Class Activities (Lecture 6)

'''
** Update your previous code to use if-elif-else statements instead. **
Let's implement a simpler version of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using conditionals.
* Rock crushes Scissors
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
1. Get two inputs from the user and stored them in variables player1_choice and player2_choice
2. Compare their choices:
    Assume player 1 always chooses 'Rock'
    When players 1 and 2 choose the same: print "It's a tie!"
    If player 2 chooses Scissors, print "Player 1 wins! Rock crushes Scissors!"
    If player 2 chooses Paper, print "Player 2 wins! Paper covers Rock!"

'''
Ask the user to input a number and store it in the variable x.
Convert the value of x into an integer. 
Check whether the number is even and greater than 17.
If yes, print "Yes!" Othwise, print "No."
Use if-else statement and a logical operator.
Hint: an even number can be exactly divided by 2, leaving a remainder of 0.
