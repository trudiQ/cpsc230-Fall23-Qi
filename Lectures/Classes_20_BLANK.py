# Class Activities (Lecture 20)

# In this exercise, you'll practice 
#   1. Create a class
#   2. Create a class instance
#   3. Add a method to a class
#   4. Access and modify instance variables
#   5. Access and modify class variables
#   6. Invoke a class method

# Exercise 1
# NOTE: You are adding code to the SAME class based on each question.
'''
E1. Define a class called 'Car' that has two instance variables 'brand' and 'model'
E2. Create a class instance named my_car with two arguments, where brand is Ford, model is Mustung
E3. Add a method named 'updateModel' within the class that modifies instance variable
    'model' with the new input argument named 'new_model'
E4: Create a class variable named 'wheels' and assign 4 to it
E5: Directly modify my_car's instance variable 'brand' to be 'Tesla'
E6: Modify my_car's instance variable 'model' to be 'Model S' using method 'updateModel'

# Exercise 2
# NOTE: You are adding code the SAME class based on each question
'''
Q1: Create a new class named 'Book' that has two instance variables, 'title' and 'author'
Q2: Create an instance of the 'Book' class, my_book, with the title '1984' and author "George Orwell"
Q3: Add a method 'display_info' to the 'Book' class that prints out the book's title and author 
    in one message. Invoke 'display_info' after creating my_book to display the book's info.
Q4: Directly modify 'title' of 'my_book' instance to 'Animal Farm'. Invoke 'display_info' to 
    display the new book info.
Q5: Q5: Create a method 'updateTitle' within the class 'Book' that updates instance variable 'title'
    with 'new_title' - input argument of the method. Invoke the 'updateTitle' with argument 'Animal Farm'.
Q6: Add a class variable 'old_or_new' to the 'Book' and assign "old" to it. Create a new book instance, new_book, 
    to be George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' and update its class variable 'old_or_new' to be 'new'. 
    Print a message in this format "xxx's yyy is old/new".
