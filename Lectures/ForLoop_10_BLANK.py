# Class Activities (Lecture 10)

'''
1. Use a for loop and range() to create integers from 0 to 5 and print them out.
'''
print("QUESTION 1:")
# write your code below




'''
2. Use a for loop and range() to create integers from 0 to 5 and print them out.
Use a loop variable to count iteration number and print it out after the for loop.
'''
print("QUESTION 2:")
# write your code below




'''
3. Put the names of your groupmates in a list (example below), then use a for
loop to print out "You're a valuable member of group [group number], [Name]"
for each name.
'''
print("QUESTION 3:")
# write your code below
names = ['Bill', 'Nicole', "John"] # replace with your groupmates names in the list



'''
4. Use a for loop to iterate a list of temperatures (Celsius), use variable num_neg 
    to count the number of below-freezing (< 0) temperatures, and print the result.
'''
print("QUESTION 4:")
temperatures = [30, 20, 2, -5, -15, -8, -1, 0, 5, 35]
num_neg = 0
# write your code below





'''
5. Ask the user to input two words of the SAME LENGTH. Using a for loop, count
how many corresponding letters are the same in the two strings. 
For example in spam and span, 3 of the letters (s,p,a) are the same. 
In the words bitter and better,5 of the letters are the same. 
Print out a message telling the user how many letters are the same.
Hint: Iterate each pair of characters of the same index in both strings and compare.
'''
print("QUESTION 5: ")
# write your code below
