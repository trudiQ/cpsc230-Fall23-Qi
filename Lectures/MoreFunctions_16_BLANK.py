    b) Write a function, named deposit(amount), that adds the input amount to account_balance.
    c) Write a function, named withdraw(), that only subtracts $10 from account_balance each time. 
    e) Write a function, named check_balance(), that prints the current account_balance.
    f) Perform a series of deposits and withdrawals, and check the balance as below. Print out the result.
        Deposite $100 => Withdraw $10 => Withdraw $10 => Deposite $30 => Check_balance
