# Class Activities (Lecture 12)
import random

'''
0. randint(a, b) is a function from a built-in library named random (see above import random)
that can be used to generate a random integer, N, between two integers, a and b, where a <= N <= b.
PART 1: Define a function, random_sum, that generates two random numbers between a and b (a < b) and return their sum.
PART 2: Invoke (use) the function to calculate the sum of two random numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
and print the result.
'''
print("QUESTION 0 ---------------")
# example: generate a random number between 0 and 9 (inclusive)
x = random.randint(0, 9)
print(x)

'''
1. Ask the user for their name, and print a welcome message to the user, e.g., "Welcome, Nicole!"
    PARK 1: Define a function that prints a welcome message using their input name.
    PARK 2: Invoke (use) the function and input the name user inputs to the function.
'''
print("QUESTION 1 ---------------")
# write your code below



'''
2. PART 1: Define a function that calculate a rectangle's perimeter based on
   its length and width as input. return its perimeter as output.
   Hint: rectangle's perimeter is 2 * (length + width). 
   PART 2: Invoke (use) the function your defined to calculate the perimeter 
   of a rectangle of length 5 and width 3 and print the result.
'''
print("QUESTION 2 ---------------")
# write your code below



'''
3. PART 1: Define a function returns True if the input number is greater than 10,
    and returns False otherwise.
   Part 2: Use the function to check the input argument of 16 and print out:
   "[argument] is greater than 10" or "[argument] is not greater than 10"

print("QUESTION 3 ---------------")
